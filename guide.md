You can broadcast any data to the Bitcoin Blockchain.

The advantages are that

1. The data is immutable - no one can ever delete or modify it.
2. The data is timestamped.
3. You can do it anonymously and choose to reveal your identity later.

The disadvantage is that

1. Only tiny amounts of data can be uploaded.

HOW

The easiest way is through [Counterwallet](https://counterwallet.io/). You'll need a tiny amount of Bitcoin; one dollar's worth will be sufficent for dozens of broadcasts. No registration is needed. Just follow the wallet's instructions.
