You can upload any data to the Bitcoin Blockchain.

The advantages are that
1) The data is immutable - no one can ever delete or modify it.
2) The data is timestamped.
3) You can do it anonymously and choose to reveal your identity later.

The disadvante is that
1) Only tiny amounts of data can be uploaded.
